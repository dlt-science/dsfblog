## Abstract

Decentralisation stands as a pivotal method for ensuring information transparency. The emergence of technologies like blockchain and Decentralised Ledger Technology (DLT) has illuminated the prospect of integrating such innovations into various infrastructures. This article delves into the workings of this technology, its applications, and its implementation strategies. Moreover, we analyse the benefits of decentralised physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) alongside the concerns surrounding their utilisation within physical infrastructures.

## Introduction

Bitcoin introduced the concept of decentralisation as a peer-to-peer cash network [5]. Decentralisation has been a main topic of discussion in recent trends [6]. This concept has also been explored in the context of transitioning traditional physical networks towards decentralisation [1].

Numerous infrastructures such as Wireless networks, cloud storage, and computing can benefit from decentralisation. DePIN, for instance, can be defined as an infrastructure network constructed, maintained, and operated through blockchain protocols within a decentralised and open network [2].

The current solution provides a centralised infrastructure for users, such as AWS, where Amazon oversees controlling and maintaining the cloud services. Conversely, in a decentralised solution, the community and token holders assume responsibility for facilitating and delivering these services. The forthcoming sections will delve into the various advantages and drawbacks of such a platform. 

## What is DePIN and How it Works

DePIN has garnered attention in recent developments for bridging decentralisation with the physical realm. Decentralisation has promised values such as enhancing transparency, reducing censorship, improving user control by accessing them to the decision-making processes and diminishing reliance on intermediaries within the network [7].

Functioning as a crypto-economic system, DePIN comprises several components, i) individual autonomous actors, ii) economic policies embedded in software iii) emergent properties arising from the interactions of those actors according to the rules defined by the software” [1, 8]

At the core of DePIN's operation lies the tokenisation model, which incentivises participants to contribute essential resources to the network. This participation entails offering resources such as GPU power, hotspots, and storage. Users within the network benefit from transactions based on supply and demand dynamics, wherein they must utilise the provided token to access storage offered by network participants [9].

With a vast network of users utilising their devices to sustain DePIN, participant verification is essential. Methods like Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) enable the verification of new members while ensuring they possess the requisite equipment without revealing their credential information [7].

## Use Cases

Filecoin stands out as a great example of DePIN utilisation, offering decentralised storage solutions. Miners can engage with the network by allocating their unused storage and earning rewards, effectively transforming cloud storage into an algorithmic market facilitated by peer-to-peer networking. 

This system uses cryptographic algorithms to ensure that all files are saved safely. The community behind Filecoin governs the network’s authority. They are committed to upholding transparency, decentralisation and open-source principles are being applied through the network.

Numerous advantages come from utilising Filecoin services. Being a decentralised network, there are no geographical limitations on user participation, fostering inclusivity. However, users should consider the efficiency of their equipment and electricity costs. Additionally, the transparency and security provided by cryptographic algorithms enhance user trust. Filecoin is commitment to open-source development ensures users have access to the latest software for seamless operation.  

Nevertheless, alongside the benefits come certain concerns. Profitability challenges have jeopardised user interest, affecting network participation. The scarcity of users providing necessary equipment and facilities has currently impacted the network's efficacy. Enhanced profitability systems and increased user engagement could mitigate these challenges and drive network growth [10, 11].

## Advantages

Ballandies et al. (2023) explore the advantages of employing DePINs across various domains. Firstly, decentralisation offers resilience and reliability to networks. Blockchain's transparency feature fosters trust among users by ensuring transparency while maintaining participant anonymity. Additionally, permissionless blockchain networks enhance scalability and utility within the infrastructure network [1].

Cost efficiency emerges as another key benefit of DePIN networks. Adopting a decentralised approach akin to AWS may cut cloud storage costs by as much as 70%. Despite challenges in infrastructure development, this approach holds promise, particularly for smaller businesses [3].

## Concerns

The Decentralised Physical Infrastructure Networks are at the beginning of their road, with much room for development and maturation. Despite all the benefits, there are some downsides to the technology as well. There are some concerns regarding the governance and the actual decentralisation of the network. Although the foundation of such networks is that they must be decentralised, they require massive technological infrastructure that may not be accessible to all users. You may have a couple of gigabytes of storage on your laptop, but this will not be enough for a massive network. Mining pools may have the advantage here. They usually come up with the required infrastructure to overtake the power in the network. This will cause the decentralisation to shift in their advantages.

Another issue with these networks is that they require massive facilities such as expensive GPUs that may not be accessible by many users. This issue can impact the scalability of the network. 

## Conclusion

Even though the DePIN technology is just on the path to becoming a revolutionary approach to decentralising physical infrastructure such as sensors, storage, GPUs and more there are several concerns regarding them. Right implementations of these physical infrastructures can help to reduce costs, increase transparency, etc. DePINs can also try to take control of the network out of centralised players such as AWS and challenge them by involving individuals to participants in the network using their Equipments.
